GifCompressor
-------------
A tool which will take a gif and compress/convert it down to a .bin file, to save size, etc..

You can just drag and drop your GIFs on the exe and they will be converted automatically. 
The tool also supports image offsets. You just need TXT file with the same name. 
Inside it there should be two rows of data: first is offset_x and second one offset_y.
